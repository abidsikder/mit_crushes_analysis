n.b. "kerb" at MIT is a unique email id for people. In the release of the data, the MIT Crush Match team anonymized it so that's why the anonymized data has these long random strings, but those just stand for people.

`anonymized_crushes.csv` = Raw data given out by the MIT Crush Match team
`in_out_degree.py` = script to calculate the file `InOutDegrees.csv` with the in and outdegrees of all the kerbs. 

The Google Sheet that generated `Indegree Distribution.pdf` and `Outdegree Distribution.pdf`:
